Technical Report: Edge AI Video Analytics System
1. Introduction
This report documents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a production-grade Edge AI Video Analytics System. The system is designed for real-time object detection and tracking on edge devices, supporting multi-backend inference (PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT), advanced model optimization, and robust deployment via FastAPI and Docker.

2. System Architecture
Training Pipeline: PyTorch-based, supports advanced augmentations (Mosaic, MixUp, CutOut), EMA, AMP, and multi-scale training.
Model Optimization: Exports models to ONNX, builds TensorRT engines (FP16/INT8), and supports entropy-based INT8 calibration.
Inference Engine: Unified API for PyTorch, ONNX, and TensorRT backends. Custom NMS, warmup, and timing statistics.
Tracking: Implements ByteTrack with Kalman filtering for robust multi-object tracking.
API Deployment: FastAPI server with endpoints for detection, health, and metrics. Dockerized for GPU deployment.
Monitoring: Real-time GPU and performance metrics, visualized via matplotlib.
Testing: Comprehensive pytest suite for all modules.
